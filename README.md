# CNN-Driven-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Enhanced-by-Explainable-AI-Techniques
This project focuses on detecting plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and enhancing its interpretability with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The model was developed using the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across multiple categories.
