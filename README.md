# CNN-Driven-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Enhanced-by-Explainable-AI-Techniques
This project focuses on detecting plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and enhancing its interpretability with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The model was developed using the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across multiple categories.




# **Plant Disease Detection Using CNN and Explainable AI**  

This repository contains the implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for detecting plant leaf diseases, enhanced with **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to ensure interpretability of predictions. The project utilizes the **PlantVillage dataset**, enabling accurate classification of healthy and diseased plant leaves across multiple categories.  



## **Features**  
- **Deep Learning Architecture**:  
  - Built on **MobileNetV2** with transfer learning to achieve efficient and accurate classification.  
- **Explainability with XAI**:
